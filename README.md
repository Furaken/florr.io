## About
Since my friends and I have quitted florr.io, so this repo will be closed and unsupported permanently.
Also this is NOT a copy of florr or the source code of it, you cannot recreate florr from this repository.

## Credit
Everything here are created by Furaken, Opfer, k2r_n2iq and teddybear.
Smaller contributors are already given credits in specific scripts.
